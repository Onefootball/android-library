# Android Urban Airship SDK

Urban Airship SDK for Android.

## Onefootball Specific Part

Sender ID check has been modified in `GcmPushProvider` class in order to support multiple 
sender IDs separated for the UrbanAirship setup (i.e.: `524564225791,650573504455,136643775234`)

To build and publish the new version do the following:  
- Rebase this GitHub fork on top the latest changes done by Urban Airship
- Update the version in `airship.properties` file by adding the `-OF` suffix to it
- Create `maven.properties` file and setup the Nexus server url and credentials (the 
  file MUST NOT be committed into Git)
- Run `gradlew urbanairship-sdk:publish`

Sample `maven.properties` file:

```
mavenPublishingUrl = https://ci.somewhere.com/nexus/content/repositories/reponame/
mavenPublishingUsername = deployer_username
mavenPublishingPassword = deployer_password
```

## Quickstart

Include Urban Airship into the build.gradle file:

```
   dependencies {
     ...

     // Urban Airship SDK
     compile 'com.urbanairship.android:urbanairship-sdk:9.0.0'
     compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:11.8.0'

     // Recommended for location services
     compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:11.8.0'
   }
```


Create a new `airshipconfig.properties` file with your applicationâ€™s settings:

```
   developmentAppKey = Your Development App Key
   developmentAppSecret = Your Development App Secret

   productionAppKey = Your Production App Key
   productionAppSecret = Your Production Secret

   # Toggles between the development and production app credentials
   # Before submitting your application to an app store set to true
   inProduction = false

   # LogLevel is "VERBOSE", "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARN", "ERROR" or "ASSERT"
   developmentLogLevel = DEBUG
   productionLogLevel = ERROR

   # FCM Sender ID
   fcmSenderId = Your Google API Project Number

   # Notification customization
   notificationIcon = ic_notification
   notificationAccentColor = #ff0000

   # Optional - Set the default channel
   notificationChannel = "customChannel"
```

Set the Autopilot meta-data in the AndroidManifest.xml file:

```
      <meta-data android:name="com.urbanairship.autopilot"
               android:value="com.urbanairship.Autopilot"/>
```

## Sample Application

A [sample](sample) application is available that showcases the majority of the features offered by
the Urban Airship SDK. Before running the sample, copy the file in `sample/src/main/assets/airshipconfig.properites.sample` to
`sample/src/main/assets/airshipconfig.properties` and modify the properties to match your application's config.

## Sample Test
An automated test is available to test basic pushes, message center and in-app messages with the Sample application.

To run the test suite on an emulator or device with API 21+:

```
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.appKey="APP_KEY" -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.masterSecret="MASTER_SECRET"
```
